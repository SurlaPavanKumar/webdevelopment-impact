            <summary>What is Python?</summary>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Python's key features include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy-to-read syntax</li>
                    <li>Dynamic typing</li>
                    <li>Automatic memory management</li>

            <summary>What is a Python decorator?</summary>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>A Python decorator is a function that modifies the behavior of another function or method. Decorators are often used to add functionality to existing code in a reusable way.</p>

    <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Questions</h2>
    <div class="question">
        <details>
            <summary>What is a linked list?</summary>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. There are two main types of linked lists: singly linked lists (where each node points to the next node) and doubly linked lists (where each node points to both the next and previous nodes).</p>

    <div class="question">
        <details>
            <summary>What is a binary search tree (BST)?</summary>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right children. In a BST, the left child's value is less than the parent's value, and the right child's value is greater than the parent's value. This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.</p>

            <summary>What is the difference between a stack and a queue?</summary>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end (the top). A queue, on the other hand, follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added from one end (the rear) and removed from the other end (the front).</p>
